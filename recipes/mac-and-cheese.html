    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Sharp cheddar cheese flavor with a kick of jalapeno.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>16 Ounces, Elbow Macaroni</li>
        <li>16 Ounces, Bite Size Bacon</li>
        <li>10 Diced Jalapenos</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons, Chile Paste</li>
        <li>4 Tablespoons, Flour</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon, Minced Garlic</li>
        <li>4 Cups, Whole Milk</li>
        <li>16 Ounces, Shredded Sharp Cheddar Cheese</li>
        <li>8 Ounces, Shredded Parmesan Cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.</li>
        <li>Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until nearly crispy, about 5 minutes. Add jalapenos and fry with bacon until soft and bacon is crispy, about 5 minutes. Drain some of the bacon fat, leaving 4 tablespoons of fat in the pan.</li>
        <li>Stir chile paste into the pan and fry for 1 minute. Add salt and pepper to taste. Add flour and cook for 1 minute. Cook and stir garlic in the pan for 1 minute. Pour in milk and cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, for 5 minutes. Remove from heat and let sit for 10 minutes to cool slightly and prevent cheese from separating.</li>
        <li>Stir Cheddar cheese and Parmesan cheese into the mixture until melted. Add drained pasta and mix together. Serve.</li>
    </ol>
